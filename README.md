# torrent adder for safari

this is similar (in fact i basically copied then just deleted the parts about labels/dirs for ruTorrent) to remote-torrent-adder but for safari.  I've never been able to get something that works as well as that in safari and thought it would always be nice since I like safari

## install 
click a link or install from the repo with extension builder i guess

## references
this is ripped in part from
